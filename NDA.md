## DISCLOSER:

*[Contact Name, Company, Address, and Contact Information]*

## RECIPIENT:

*[Contact Name, Company, Address, and Contact Information]*

*[Name of Discloser]* ("Discloser") may disclose confidential information to the person identified above ("Recipient") so that Recipient can participate meaningfully with Discloser (the "Transaction"). In order to protect the information, Discloser and Recipient, intending to be legally bound, agree that:

1. Recipient shall keep confidential any nonpublic information about Discloser, including, but not limited to, ideas, concepts, business plans, charts, graphs, designs, brands, costs, prices, names, finances, marketing plans, business opportunities, forecasts, orders, personnel, customer information, research, development, third party confidential information, code, processes, procedures, know-how, prototypes, products (whether existing or proposed), identities of individuals and entities, descriptions of any properties, or the existence of any of Discloser's property ("Information"), whether written, oral, electronic, embodied in samples, or in other forms. 

2. Recipient shall protect Information from disclosure by using reasonable care, but at least the same degree of care as Recipient uses to protect his own confidential .

3. Recipient shall not use or allow others to access, use, or analyze Information without prior authorization. 

4. At Discloser's request, Recipient shall return all materials furnished by Discloser containing Information and shall destroy or deliver to Discloser any other materials containing Information. Upon request, Recipient will state in writing under oath whether it has complied.

5. This agreement shall remain in effect as long as Recipient possesses Information, but shall not apply to Information that: (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of Recipient; or (b) is or has been received in good faith by Recipient without restriction on use or disclosure from a third party having no obligation of confidentiality to Discloser; or (c) is or has been independently developed by Recipient without reference to Information received from Discloser, as evidenced by Recipient's written records. For purposes of this agreement, Information shall not be deemed to be publicly available or in the Recipient's possession merely because it may be embraced by a more general disclosure, or derived from combinations of disclosures which may be publicly available or in the Recipient's possession.

6. If Recipient is required by judicial or administrative process to disclose Information, Recipient shall promptly notify Discloser and allow Discloser a reasonable time to oppose such process. If disclosure is nonetheless required, Recipient may disclose only the Information that, in the written opinion of counsel acceptable to Discloser, Recipient is legally required to disclose. Recipient shall use his best efforts to limit the dissemination of Information that is disclosed.

7. This agreement does not require either party to enter into any other agreement or any other business relationship, does not create any agency or partnership between the parties, and shall not be construed as granting Recipient a license or any other rights in the Information.

8. In the event of a default under this agreement, Discloser shall be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any other available remedies, including damages, without the necessity of posting a bond. In any litigation concerning this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses of litigation, including reasonable attorney fees at trial and on any appeal.

9. This agreement shall be governed by the law of the state of Oregon, without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The exclusive venue for any disputes shall be Portland, Oregon, and the parties hereby agree to the personal jurisdiction of Oregon.

10. All additions or modifications to this agreement must be made in writing and executed by both parties.
